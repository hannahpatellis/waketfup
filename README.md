# Wake T.F. Up

I'm a heavy sleeper and normal alarms won't cut it. I sleep through them, the same alarm noise I get used to, et cetera. So I wrote this app to help me wake up, as well as showing me the time and my morning routine.

This app is designed to run on a Windows 10 machine using the Windows Task Scheduler and is currently still under development so it doesn't work.

**Features**
- Randomly choose an audio clip from a directory to play as the alarm, mixing them up at various intervals
- Snooze functions
- Background sunrise video and morning routine display
